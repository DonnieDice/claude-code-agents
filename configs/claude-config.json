To do that, you can use this approach:\n\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats\">\n    <img height=200 align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra\"       \n  />\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/convoychat\">\n    <img height=200 align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs?username=anur     \n  aghazra&layout=compact&langs_count=8&card_width=320\" />\n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats\">\n    <img align=\"center\"\n  src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=github-readme-stats\" />       \n  </a>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/convoychat\">\n    <img align=\"center\"\n  src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=convoychat\" />\n  </a>\n  👀 Show example\n  Deploy on your own\n  On Vercel\n  📽️ Check Out Step By Step Video Tutorial By @codeSTACKr\n  Since the GitHub API only allows 5k requests per hour, my https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api\n  could possibly hit the rate limiter. If you host it on your own Vercel server, then you do not have to       \n  worry about anything. Click on the deploy button to get started!\n\n  Note\n\n  Since #58, we should be able to handle more than 5k requests and have fewer issues with downtime 😁.\n\n  Note\n\n  If you are on the Pro (i.e. paid) Vercel plan, the maxDuration value found in the vercel.json can be\n  increased when your Vercel instance frequently times out during the card request. You are advised to\n  keep this value lower than 30 seconds to prevent high memory usage.\n\n  Deploy to Vercel\n\n  🛠️ Step-by-step guide on setting up your own Vercel instance\n  On other platforms\n  Warning\n\n  This way of using GRS is not officially supported and was added to cater to some particular use cases        \n  where Vercel could not be used (e.g. #2341). The support for this method, therefore, is limited.\n\n  🛠️ Step-by-step guide for deploying on other platforms\n  Disable rate limit protections\n  Github Readme Stats contains several Vercel environment variables that can be used to remove the rate        \n  limit protections:\n\n  CACHE_SECONDS: This environment variable takes precedence over our cache minimum and maximum values and      \n  can circumvent these values for self-hosted Vercel instances.\n  See the Vercel documentation on adding these environment variables to your Vercel instance.\n\n  Keep your fork up to date\n  You can keep your fork, and thus your private Vercel instance up to date with the upstream using\n  GitHub's Sync Fork button. You can also use the pull package created by @wei to automate this process.       \n\n  💖 Support the project\n  I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects.        \n  Obviously, this takes time. You can use this service for free.\n\n  However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue        \n  creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:\n\n  Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it. :D\n  Starring and sharing the project. 🚀\n  paypal.me/anuraghazra - You can make a one-time donations via PayPal.

This ensures that when users click on the WakaTime stats badge,\n  they'll be properly directed to your WakaTime profile where they can view your development statistics.       \n\n  The WakaTime API call for the stats image itself\n  (https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/wakatime?username=donniedice) is working correctly - it was      \n  just the click-through link that needed fixing.\n\n> did we update the readme? - also give me a command to create a deployment code for claude code\n\n● Yes, we did update the README! We completely transformed it in the v2.1.13 release with:\n\n  - Complete RGX Mods structure with professional header, community sections, and statistics\n  - Discord community integration with 4+ touchpoints throughout\n  - Comprehensive GitHub badges and statistics positioned at the bottom\n  - Professional content organization with tables, features, and command reference\n  - WakaTime link fix (just pushed) to point to your proper WakaTime profile\n\n  The README now follows the exact RGX Mods standards with proper section ordering: Header → Community →       \n  Support → Content → Stats (bottom).\n\n  For Claude Code deployment, here's the command:\n\n  # Create a new Claude Code deployment\n  claude-code deploy --name \"fflu-v2.1.13\" --description \"FFLU RGX Mods Transformation\" --auto-commit\n\n  Or if you want to create a deployment configuration file:\n\n  # Create deployment config\n  cat > .claude-deploy.json << 'EOF'\n  {\n    \"name\": \"fflu-rgx-mods\",\n    \"version\": \"2.1.13\",\n    \"description\": \"FFLU - Final Fantasy Level-Up!

Here's a focused prompt to fix the README statistics links:\n\n  ---\n  🔧 Fix README Statistics Links & Badges\n\n  The README's statistics section has incorrect links and needs proper badge updates. Fix the following:       \n\n  Issues to Fix:\n  1. WakaTime Stats: Link should point to https://wakatime.com/@donniedice (not GitHub repo)\n  2. GitHub Stats Images: All stats images should link to the repository\n  (https://github.com/donniedice/FFLU)\n  3. Badge Consistency: Ensure all GitHub badges use correct repository links\n  4. Broken Links: Fix any badges that don't resolve properly\n\n  Specific Changes Needed:\n  - Update WakaTime stats link to proper profile\n  - Fix GitHub stats images to link to repository\n  - Verify all badge URLs are working\n  - Ensure GitHub Activity Graph links correctly\n  - Check GitHub Streak stats link\n  - Validate all repository metrics badges\n\n  Test Requirements:\n  - All badges should display properly\n  - All links should navigate to correct destinations\n  - WakaTime badge should link to WakaTime profile\n  - GitHub stats should link to repository\n  - No broken or 404 links\n\n  Files to Update:\n  - README.md - Fix all statistics section links and badges\n\n  This focused fix ensures all README statistics display correctly and link to proper destinations without     \n   breaking the existing RGX Mods structure.\n\n> Checkout via the command line\n  If you do not want to use the merge button or an automatic merge cannot be performed, you can perform a      \n  manual merge on the command line.

We use caching to prevent this from happening (see https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#common-options). You can turn off these rate limit protections by deploying your own Vercel instance.\n\nUptime Badge\n\nImportant\n\nWe're a small team, and to prioritize, we rely on upvotes 👍. We use the Top Issues dashboard for tracking community demand (see #1935). Do not hesitate to upvote the issues and pull requests you are interested in. We will work on the most upvoted first.\n\nGitHub Stats Card\nCopy and paste this into your markdown, and that's it. Simple!\n\nChange the ?username= value to your GitHub username.\n\n[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)\nWarning\n\nBy default, the stats card only shows statistics like stars, commits, and pull requests from public repositories. To show private statistics on the stats card, you should deploy your own instance using your own GitHub API token.\n\nNote\n\nAvailable ranks are S (top 1%), A+ (12.5%), A (25%), A- (37.5%), B+ (50%), B (62.5%), B- (75%), C+ (87.5%) and C (everyone). This ranking scheme is based on the Japanese academic grading system. The global percentile is calculated as a weighted sum of percentiles for each statistic (number of commits, pull requests, reviews, issues, stars, and followers), based on the cumulative distribution function of the exponential and the log-normal distributions. The implementation can be investigated at src/calculateRank.js. The circle around the rank shows 100 minus the global percentile.\n\nHiding individual stats\nYou can pass a query parameter &hide= to hide any specific stats with comma-separated values.\n\nOptions: &hide=stars,commits,prs,issues,contribs\n\n![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&hide=contribs,prs)\nShowing additional individual stats\nYou can pass a query parameter &show= to show any specific additional stats with comma-separated values.\n\nOptions: &show=reviews,discussions_started,discussions_answered,prs_merged,prs_merged_percentage\n\n![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show=reviews,discussions_started,discussions_answered,prs_merged,prs_merged_percentage)\nShowing icons\nTo enable icons, you can pass &show_icons=true in the query param, like so:\n\n![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true)\nThemes\nWith inbuilt themes, you can customize the look of the card without doing any manual customization.\n\nUse &theme=THEME_NAME parameter like so :\n\n![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=radical)\nAll inbuilt themes\nGitHub Readme Stats comes with several built-in themes (e.g. dark, radical, merko, gruvbox, tokyonight, onedark, cobalt, synthwave, highcontrast, dracula).\n\nGitHub Readme Stats Themes\n\nYou can look at a preview for all available themes or checkout the theme config file. Please note that we paused the addition of new themes to decrease maintenance efforts; all pull requests related to new themes will be closed.\n\nResponsive Card Theme\nAnurag's GitHub stats-Dark\n\nSince GitHub will re-upload the cards and serve them from their CDN, we can not infer the browser/GitHub theme on the server side. There are, however, four methods you can use to create dynamics themes on the client side.\n\nUse the transparent theme\nWe have included a transparent theme that has a transparent background. This theme is optimized to look good on GitHub's dark and light default themes. You can enable this theme using the &theme=transparent parameter like so:\n\n![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=transparent)\n👀 Show example\nAdd transparent alpha channel to a themes bg_color\nYou can use the bg_color parameter to make any of the available themes transparent. This is done by setting the bg_color to a color with a transparent alpha channel (i.e. bg_color=00000000):\n\n![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&bg_color=00000000)\n👀 Show example\nUse GitHub's theme context tag\nYou can use GitHub's theme context tags to switch the theme based on the user GitHub theme automatically. This is done by appending #gh-dark-mode-only or #gh-light-mode-only to the end of an image URL. This tag will define whether the image specified in the markdown is only shown to viewers using a light or a dark GitHub theme:\n\n[![Anurag's GitHub stats-Dark](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=dark#gh-dark-mode-only)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#gh-dark-mode-only)\n[![Anurag's GitHub stats-Light](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=default#gh-light-mode-only)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#gh-light-mode-only)\n👀 Show example\nUse GitHub's new media feature\nYou can use GitHub's new media feature in HTML to specify whether to display images for light or dark themes. This is done using the HTML <picture> element in combination with the prefers-color-scheme media feature.\n\n<picture>\n  <source\n    srcset=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true&theme=dark\"\n    media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n  />\n  <source\n    srcset=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true\"\n    media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light), (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)\"\n  />\n  <img src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra&show_icons=true\" />\n</picture>\n👀 Show example\nCustomization\nYou can customize the appearance of all your cards however you wish with URL parameters.\n\nCommon Options\nName    Description    Type    Default value\ntitle_color    Card's title color.    string (hex color)    2f80ed\ntext_color    Body text color.    string (hex color)    434d58\nicon_color    Icons color if available.    string (hex color)    4c71f2\nborder_color    Card's border color.

To include languages used in private repositories, you should deploy your own instance using your own GitHub API token.\n\nNote\n\nTop Languages does not indicate the user's skill level or anything like that; it's a GitHub metric to determine which languages have the most code on GitHub. It is a new feature of github-readme-stats.\n\nWarning\n\nThis card shows language usage only inside your own non-forked repositories, not depending on who the author of the commits is. It does not include your contributions into another users/organizations repositories. Currently there are no way to get this data from GitHub API. If you want this behavior to be improved you can support this feature request created by @rickstaa inside GitHub Community.\n\nWarning\n\nCurrently this card shows data only about first 100 repositories. This is because GitHub API limitations which cause downtimes of public instances (see #1471). In future this behavior will be improved by releasing GitHub action or providing environment variables for user's own instances.\n\nUsage\nCopy-paste this code into your readme and change the links.\n\nEndpoint: api/top-langs?username=anuraghazra\n\n[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)\nLanguage stats algorithm\nWe use the following algorithm to calculate the languages percentages on the language card:\n\nranking_index = (byte_count ^ size_weight) * (repo_count ^ count_weight)\nBy default, only the byte count is used for determining the languages percentages shown on the language card (i.e. size_weight=1 and count_weight=0). You can, however, use the &size_weight= and &count_weight= options to weight the language usage calculation. The values must be positive real numbers. More details about the algorithm can be found here.\n\n&size_weight=1&count_weight=0 - (default) Orders by byte count.\n&size_weight=0.5&count_weight=0.5 - (recommended) Uses both byte and repo count for ranking\n&size_weight=0&count_weight=1 - Orders by repo count\n![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&size_weight=0.5&count_weight=0.5)\nExclude individual repositories\nYou can use the &exclude_repo=repo1,repo2 parameter to exclude individual repositories.\n\n![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&exclude_repo=github-readme-stats,anuraghazra.github.io)\nHide individual languages\nYou can use &hide=language1,language2 parameter to hide individual languages.\n\n![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&hide=javascript,html)\nShow more languages\nYou can use the &langs_count= option to increase or decrease the number of languages shown on the card. Valid values are integers between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

To do that, you can use this approach:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats\">\n  <img height=200 align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/convoychat\">\n  <img height=200 align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs?username=anuraghazra&layout=compact&langs_count=8&card_width=320\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats\">\n  <img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=github-readme-stats\" />\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/anuraghazra/convoychat\">\n  <img align=\"center\" src=\"https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=convoychat\" />\n</a>\n👀 Show example\nDeploy on your own\nOn Vercel\n📽️ Check Out Step By Step Video Tutorial By @codeSTACKr\nSince the GitHub API only allows 5k requests per hour, my https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api could possibly hit the rate limiter. If you host it on your own Vercel server, then you do not have to worry about anything. Click on the deploy button to get started!\n\nNote\n\nSince #58, we should be able to handle more than 5k requests and have fewer issues with downtime 😁.\n\nNote\n\nIf you are on the Pro (i.e. paid) Vercel plan, the maxDuration value found in the vercel.json can be increased when your Vercel instance frequently times out during the card request. You are advised to keep this value lower than 30 seconds to prevent high memory usage.\n\nDeploy to Vercel\n\n🛠️ Step-by-step guide on setting up your own Vercel instance\nOn other platforms\nWarning\n\nThis way of using GRS is not officially supported and was added to cater to some particular use cases where Vercel could not be used (e.g. #2341). The support for this method, therefore, is limited.\n\n🛠️ Step-by-step guide for deploying on other platforms\nDisable rate limit protections\nGithub Readme Stats contains several Vercel environment variables that can be used to remove the rate limit protections:\n\nCACHE_SECONDS: This environment variable takes precedence over our cache minimum and maximum values and can circumvent these values for self-hosted Vercel instances.\nSee the Vercel documentation on adding these environment variables to your Vercel instance.\n\nKeep your fork up to date\nYou can keep your fork, and thus your private Vercel instance up to date with the upstream using GitHub's Sync Fork button. You can also use the pull package created by @wei to automate this process.\n\n💖 Support the project\nI open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can use this service for free.\n\nHowever, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:\n\nGiving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it. :D\nStarring and sharing the project. 🚀\npaypal.me/anuraghazra - You can make a one-time donations via PayPal.

              "content": "Got it — you want to **orchestrate Claude Code** so that it uses **your other connected LLM agents** (DeepSeek GPT, Gemini) to cross-check and flesh out BLU’s **scope and functionality** with actual repository code access.\n\nHere’s a practical approach that works well when one model (Claude Code) has repo access but you want multiple models to collaborate:\n\n---\n\n## **1. Frame the Objective Clearly**\n\nClaude Code needs an explicit job:\n\n* **Primary**: Extract all relevant implementation details from BLU\\_Classic’s code (functions, event flow, UI, saved vars, sound logic).\n* **Secondary**: Collaborate with other agents (DeepSeek GPT, Gemini) to verify interpretation, document scope, and identify edge cases.\n\nYou tell Claude Code something like:\n\n> *\"Your goal is to produce an authoritative technical write-up of the **scope and functionality** of the BLU\\_Classic addon.\n> Step 1: Use your repo access to extract all Lua files, `.toc` files, and related resources, and produce a structured outline of all components (per file).\n> Step 2: Send that outline to DeepSeek GPT to verify completeness and suggest missing pieces.\n> Step 3: Send the refined outline and any identified gaps to Gemini to produce a final, reader-friendly scope and functionality summary.\n> Step 4: Return the combined, reconciled result, noting where models disagreed.\"*\n\n---\n\n## **2. Break the Job Into Stages for the Agents**\n\n### **Stage 1 — Claude Code** (repo-connected model)\n\n* Traverse repo file tree.\n* For each `.lua` and `.toc`:\n\n  * Extract purpose, events handled, major functions, cross-file dependencies.\n  * Record all configuration tables (options, defaults).\n  * Map event → handler → sound.\n  * Identify UI components and slash commands.\n* Output as **JSON/structured table** for hand-off.\n\n### **Stage 2 — DeepSeek GPT** (pattern-recognition + code reasoning)\n\n* Input: JSON/structured table from Stage 1.\n* Tasks:\n\n  * Detect missing files, unused functions, event coverage gaps.\n  * Cross-check function naming vs. actual event binding.\n  * Flag edge cases (e.g., overwritten event handlers, localization issues).\n  * Suggest extra scope items Claude might have missed.\n\n### **Stage 3 — Gemini** (natural-language synthesis)\n\n* Input: Claude’s structured table + DeepSeek’s gap analysis.\n* Tasks:\n\n  * Merge into **one unified, narrative write-up**.\n  * Include:\n\n    * High-level scope statement.\n    * Functional breakdown (events, menus, sounds, saved vars).\n    * Technical implementation overview.\n    * Version-specific behavior.\n  * Present in human-readable sections for documentation or README.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Prompt Templates for Each Agent**\n\n### **Claude Code Prompt**\n\n```plaintext\nYou have repo access.  \nGoal: Extract a complete technical map of BLU_Classic's scope and functionality.\n\n1. Get the full folder tree.\n2. For each Lua file:\n   - File name\n   - Purpose in addon\n   - Public functions & what they do\n   - Events registered & handlers\n   - Cross-file dependencies\n   - Any user-facing commands/UI\n3. From .toc files:\n   - Interface version targets\n   - File load order\n   - SavedVariables listed\n4. Produce output as structured JSON like:\n{\n \"files\": [\n   {\n     \"name\": \"core.lua\",\n     \"purpose\": \"...\",\n     \"events\": [...],\n     \"functions\": [{name: \"...\", desc: \"...\"}],\n     \"ui\": [...],\n     \"depends_on\": [...]\n   }\n ],\n \"saved_variables\": [...],\n \"versions_supported\": [...]\n}\nDo NOT summarize — capture every detail for hand-off.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **DeepSeek GPT Prompt**\n\n```plaintext\nYou are reviewing Claude's technical map of BLU_Classic.\n\n1. Cross-check that all events and functions in code are accounted for.\n2. Identify missing:\n   - Files not analyzed\n   - Functions not documented\n   - Event handlers overwritten or unused\n   - UI/menu sections\n3. Point out ambiguous areas that require inspection.\n4. Suggest clarifying questions for the developer.\nOutput as a bullet list of:\n- Gaps\n- Risks\n- Suggested clarifications\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Gemini Prompt**\n\n```plaintext\nUsing Claude's detailed technical map and DeepSeek's gap analysis, write a final\nauthoritative narrative describing BLU_Classic's:\n\n1. Scope — what the addon is for, supported WoW events, intended player use cases.\n2. Functionality — how it hooks into WoW APIs, event flow, menu/UI features, version-specific logic.\n3. Technical implementation — per major file/module, summarize responsibilities.\n4. Differences in Retail vs. Classic behavior.\n5. Known limitations or risks.\n\nWrite it in clear, technical prose suitable for a developer audience.\n```\n\n---\n\n## **4. Tips to Get Good Output**\n\n* **Force sequential execution** — have Claude explicitly call the other agents in order, and only move to the next stage after merging feedback.\n* **Ask for structured outputs** from Claude and DeepSeek to make Gemini’s merge job easier.\n* **Preserve raw code references** in Claude’s output so Gemini can pull exact examples.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can draft a **ready-to-run multi-agent orchestration script** that tells Claude exactly how to query your repo and chain results through DeepSeek and Gemini. That would make them work like one “super-reviewer” for BLU.\n\nDo you want me to write that orchestration prompt/script next?\n"

              "content": "Thanks — now that you’ve uploaded code I can give a real, concrete analysis of **scope** and **functionality** (what the addon actually does), plus call out bugs, missing pieces, and recommended fixes. I’ll cover:\n\n* What the code *does* and the addon *scope* (based on the three uploaded files).\n* How the addon implements that functionality (event flow, sound playback hooks, options integration).\n* Concrete issues / bugs (with short explanations).\n* Safe, focused code fixes (small diffs / replacement snippets you can apply).\n* Next steps and what I still need to finish a full audit.\n\n---\n\n# 1) What this code actually implements — Scope & functionality (based on uploaded files)\n\n**Primary scope**\n\n* BLU is a lightweight event → sound mapper for milestone events (level up, quest accept/complete, achievements, reputation rank-ups, and several Retail-only events).\n* It is **version aware** (vanilla / cata / retail) and enables/disables UI groups and event handlers depending on detected game version.\n* It exposes an options UI via **AceConfig / AceConfigDialog** and supports **profiles** via AceDB / AceDBOptions.\n* It mutes specific Blizzard sound IDs on startup for the current version (via a `muteSoundIDs` table).\n* It provides debug printing and a welcome message toggle.\n\n**Events handled** (from `initialization.lua` + functions in `core.lua`):\n\n* PLAYER\\_ENTERING\\_WORLD (handler not in provided files)\n* PLAYER\\_LEVEL\\_UP → `HandlePlayerLevelUp`\n* QUEST\\_ACCEPTED → `HandleQuestAccepted`\n* QUEST\\_TURNED\\_IN → `HandleQuestTurnedIn`\n* CHAT\\_MSG\\_SYSTEM → routed to reputation/delve logic (see quirks below)\n* Retail-only (only registered when `GetGameVersion()` returns `\"retail\"`):\n  `MAJOR_FACTION_RENOWN_LEVEL_CHANGED`, `PERKS_ACTIVITY_COMPLETED`, `ACHIEVEMENT_EARNED`, `HONOR_LEVEL_UPDATE`, `TRAIT_CONFIG_UPDATED`, `UPDATE_FACTION`, `UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED`, `PET_BATTLE_LEVEL_CHANGED`, `UNIT_PET_EXPERIENCE`, `PET_JOURNAL_LIST_UPDATE`\n\n**UI / Options behavior**\n\n* Options are constructed in `self.options` (not included in these uploads). `InitializeOptions()`:\n\n  * Determines game version and removes incompatible option groups (so the options panel is tailored by version).\n  * Sorts option groups and colorizes group/arg labels (via `AssignGroupColors`).\n  * Registers the options table with AceConfig and adds it to Blizzard’s Interface Options.\n  * Registers AceDB Profiles under the same UI.\n\n**Sound playback**\n\n* The files call `self:HandleEvent(...)` and `self:TestSound(...)` to perform play logic. These functions are not in the uploaded set, so I assume those live in another file (utils.lua / play.lua). The core file simply maps events to sound-selection keys and default sounds.\n\n**Reputation handling**\n\n* Reputation rank increases are detected by filtering `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` text (English message matching), then calling `ReputationRankIncrease()` which delegates to `HandleEvent(\"REPUTATION_RANK_INCREASE\", ...)`.\n\n**Delve companion (Retail)**\n\n* Detects a chat system message like `\"Brann Bronzebeard has reached Level X\"` and triggers a DELVE\\_LEVEL\\_UP sound via `HandleEvent`.\n\n---\n\n# 2) How the implementation flows (high-level execution path)\n\n1. **OnInitialize**\n\n   * Create `self.db` via AceDB using `self.defaults`.\n   * Populate missing `self.db.profile` keys with `self.defaults.profile` values.\n   * Set `self.debugMode` and `self.showWelcomeMessage` from DB.\n   * Register `/blu` chat command and events via `RegisterSharedEvents`.\n   * Call `InitializeOptions()` — register AceConfig tables and add to Blizzard options (if `self.options` exists).\n   * Mute sound IDs (from `muteSoundIDs[self:GetGameVersion()]`) using `MuteSoundFile`.\n   * Print welcome message if enabled.\n\n2. **Event Registration**\n\n   * `RegisterSharedEvents()` builds an `events` table keyed by WoW event name and valued with the *method name string* to call.\n   * It conditionally appends retail/cata-specific events.\n   * For each `event, handler in pairs(events)` it registers the event with AceEvent if `self[handler]` is a function.\n\n3. **Event Handlers in `core.lua`**\n\n   * Each handler simply calls `self:HandleEvent(eventName, soundSelectKey, volumeKey, defaultSound, debugMessageKey)`.\n   * Test functions call `self:TestSound(soundSelectKey, volumeKey, defaultSound, debugMessageKey)`.\n\n4. **Chat message hooks**\n\n   * `ReputationChatFrameHook()` installs a message filter for `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` via `ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter` — examines chat messages for English phrases like `\"You are now Exalted with\"` etc. and calls `ReputationRankIncrease(...)`.\n   * `OnDelveCompanionLevelUp` listens for the same `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` and parses Brann messages.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Concrete issues and bugs (priority ordered)\n\n### A — **CHAT\\_MSG\\_SYSTEM registration conflict / handler overwrite**\n\n* In `RegisterSharedEvents()` you initially set `events.CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM = \"ReputationChatFrameHook\"`. Later, when `version == \"retail\"`, you set `events.CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM = \"OnDelveCompanionLevelUp\"`. Setting the same key overwrites the first value, so only one of the two methods will be registered for `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` (whichever assignment happens last).\n* **Effect:** In retail, `ReputationChatFrameHook` will *not* be registered because it gets replaced. That will break reputation detection in retail builds.\n\n### B — **ReputationChatFrameHook has many duplicated `elseif` branches with identical patterns**\n\n* There are multiple `elseif string.match(msg, \"Your standing with\") then` checks repeated — they’re identical, so only the first will ever be reached. Those repeated blocks appear to be intended to match different rank strings but currently do not.\n* Also `Mastermind` branch sets `\"Hated\"` when calling `ReputationRankIncrease` — likely a copy/paste mistake.\n* **Effect:** Reputation rank detection will only work for the explicitly spelled-out strings (Exalted, Revered, etc.). The repeated `\"Your standing with\"` blocks do nothing useful and are confusing.\n\n### C — **Localization dependence / hardcoded English strings**\n\n* `ReputationChatFrameHook` uses English message fragments (`\"You are now Exalted with\"`, `\"Your standing with\"`, etc.). This will **fail on non-English clients**.\n* **Effect:** Non-English locales will not trigger reputation sounds.\n\n### D — **`ReputationRankIncrease` ignores faction name, uses only HandleEvent**\n\n* It extracts `factionName` but never uses it. Possibly acceptable if you only need to trigger a generic reputation sound, but if the intention was to show which faction or do per-faction custom behavior, the function is incomplete.\n* **Effect:** Potential missed opportunity for richer behavior; minor bug only if faction info expected.\n\n### E — **`defaultSounds`, `self.defaults`, `self.options`, `muteSoundIDs`, and play functions missing from uploads**\n\n* Many referenced resources and functions (HandleEvent, TestSound, defaults) are not in these three files. I need the rest of the code to confirm behavior and identify more issues.\n* **Effect:** I cannot confirm exact playback mechanics, volume math, saved-variable schema, or options layout without those files.\n\n### F — **`GetGameVersion()` logic could misclassify some clients**\n\n* Uses `local _, _, _, interfaceVersion = GetBuildInfo()` and then numeric checks: `<20000` => vanilla, `>=40000 and <50000` => cata, `>=100000` => retail. That may be fine for targeted versions but consider edge cases for other BC/Wrath-era or future clients. Also `GetBuildInfo()` returns strings for some values in various clients (ensure `interfaceVersion` is numeric).\n* **Effect:** Mis-detection could cause wrong event registration or option removal.\n\n---\n\n# 4) Suggested fixes (small patches / replacement snippets)\n\nBelow are focused changes you can apply to the uploaded files to fix the immediate bugs described. These patches assume minimal changes to other code.\n\n### Fix 1 — Register both chat handlers (avoid overwrite)\n\nReplace the `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` assignment logic in `RegisterSharedEvents()` with code that registers both handlers by registering the event once and ensuring both methods are called, or by adding a wrapper handler.\n\n**Option A — preferred: register both by adding a wrapper dispatcher**\n\nReplace the `events` building and registration lines that set `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` with this patch in `initialization.lua`:\n\n```lua\n-- remove earlier direct assignment of CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM in events table\n-- after building events, handle CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM specially to call multiple handlers\n\nlocal chatSystemHandlers = {}\n\n-- add reputation handler for all versions\ntable.insert(chatSystemHandlers, \"ReputationChatFrameHook\")\n\nif version == \"retail\" then\n    -- retail also wants delve handler\n    table.insert(chatSystemHandlers, \"OnDelveCompanionLevelUp\")\nend\n\n-- Register other events normally\nfor event, handler in pairs(events) do\n    if event ~= \"CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM\" then\n        if type(self[handler]) == \"function\" then\n            self:RegisterEvent(event, handler)\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n-- Register CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM once with a dispatcher that calls all handlers we want\nif #chatSystemHandlers > 0 then\n    self:RegisterEvent(\"CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM\", function(frame, event, ...)\n        for _, handlerName in ipairs(chatSystemHandlers) do\n            if type(self[handlerName]) == \"function\" then\n                -- call handler method with same signature as normally used\n                self[handlerName](self, event, ...)\n            end\n        end\n    end)\nend\n```\n\n**Why:** This ensures both reputation parsing and delve parsing receive `CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM` events regardless of version ordering. It avoids collision and is explicit.\n\n---\n\n### Fix 2 — Clean up `ReputationChatFrameHook()` and use a table-driven matcher\n\nReplace the long repeated `elseif` chain with a table of patterns → rank mapping, making it maintainable, fix copy/paste mistakes, and make it easier to add localization later.\n\nReplace the body of `ReputationChatFrameHook()` with:\n\n```lua\nfunction BLU:ReputationChatFrameHook()\n    if BLU.chatFrameHooked then return end\n\n    local rankPatterns = {\n        [\"You are now Exalted with\"] = \"Exalted\",\n        [\"You are now Revered with\"] = \"Revered\",\n        [\"You are now Honored with\"] = \"Honored\",\n        [\"You are now Friendly with\"] = \"Friendly\",\n        [\"You are now Neutral with\"] = \"Neutral\",\n        [\"You are now Unfriendly with\"] = \"Unfriendly\",\n        [\"You are now Hostile with\"] = \"Hostile\",\n        [\"You are now Hated with\"] = \"Hated\",\n        -- legacy/alternate formats; if you need to match other English variants add here\n        -- [\"Your standing with .* has changed\"] = \"SomeRank\",    -- example\n    }\n\n    ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter(\"CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM\", function(_, _, msg)\n        self:PrintDebugMessage(\"INCOMING_CHAT_MESSAGE: \" .. tostring(msg))\n\n        local rankFound = false\n        for pattern, rankName in pairs(rankPatterns) do\n            if string.find(msg, pattern, 1, true) then\n                self:PrintDebugMessage(\"|cff00ff00Rank found: \" .. rankName .. \"|r\")\n                self:ReputationRankIncrease(rankName, msg)\n                rankFound = true\n                break\n            end\n        end\n\n        if not rankFound then\n            self:PrintDebugMessage(\"NO_RANK_FOUND\")\n        end\n\n        return false\n    end)\n\n    BLU.chatFrameHooked = true\nend\n```\n\n**Why:** Table-driven checks are easier to maintain and avoid accidental duplicate checks. `string.find(..., 1, true)` uses plain-text search (not pattern matching) to avoid pitfalls with magic characters; change if you need pattern matching.\n\n---\n\n### Fix 3 — Use locale-safe reputation detection (longer term)\n\nRight now, detection is English-only. To make it locale-aware, you should **use WoW API where possible** (there are APIs for faction standing changes in Retail/Classic) or provide translations via localization tables. Example suggestion:\n\n* Add a `BLU.L.REPUTATION_PATTERNS` table keyed by locale that maps to localized message fragments, and use `GetLocale()` to pick the right set.\n* Where API exists (Retail), prefer event-based faction APIs like `UPDATE_FACTION` and `C_Reputation.GetFactionParentalInfo()` etc. (requires further code and file additions).\n\n---\n\n### Fix 4 — Use `string.match` carefully in `ReputationRankIncrease`\n\nYou have:\n\n```lua\nlocal factionName = string.match(msg, \"with (.+)\")\nself:HandleEvent(\"REPUTATION_RANK_INCREASE\", \"RepSoundSelect\", \"RepVolume\", defaultSounds[6], \"REPUTATION_RANK_INCREASE_TRIGGERED\")\n```\n\nIf you want to capture a clean faction name, make the pattern more specific and trim trailing punctuation:\n\n```lua\nlocal factionName = string.match(msg, \"with ([%w%p ]+)\")\nif factionName then\n    factionName = factionName:gsub(\"%.$\", \"\"):trim() -- remove trailing dot, whitespace (add trim helper)\nend\n-- then pass factionName to a more advanced handler if needed\n```\n\n(You’d need to implement `trim()` or use `gsub` patterns.)\n\n---\n\n# 5) Additional recommendations & observations\n\n* **Add nil checks**: many places use `self.defaults`, `self.options`, `defaultSounds` without guarding in the uploaded code — your `OnInitialize()` does some defaults filling but add defensive checks where referenced elsewhere.\n* **Confirm `self.options` construction**: `InitializeOptions()` expects `self.options` to be set up before call. Ensure options table is created before `OnInitialize()` calls `InitializeOptions()`. If options are built in another file, ensure load order in TOC brings that file earlier.\n* **Document SavedVariables**: the `self.defaults` table is key for DB schema — include it and version migrations (if any).\n* **Test GetGameVersion for edge cases**: Explicitly convert `interfaceVersion` to number: `tonumber(interfaceVersion)` before compares.\n* **Localization**: Move all user visible strings and chat-match fragments into `localization.lua` and provide per-locale overrides. Right now BLU already has `BLU_L` structure — extend it for chat patterns.\n* **Unit tests / debug toggles**: You already have debug printing — consider a `/blu test <event>` command to emulate events for QA.\n\n---\n\n# 6) What I still need to finish a complete, line-by-line audit\n\nYou uploaded three key files — thanks, that made this analysis specific and actionable. To complete the full code-level audit (function-by-function, exact saved variable schema, options/menus layout, sound play implementation and volume math) I need the rest of the codebase:\n\n* `utils.lua` or whatever file implements `HandleEvent`, `TestSound`, `PrintDebugMessage`, `TestSound`, `HandleSlashCommands`, and other helpers.\n* `options.lua` or the file that builds `self.options` (the AceConfig options table).\n* `defaults.lua` (or wherever `self.defaults` is defined) and `defaultSounds` + `muteSoundIDs`.\n* Any other modules referenced by the core (battlepets.lua, achievements.lua, etc. — if present).\n* The `.toc` file (to confirm load order) and any other Lua assets.\n\nIf you want, upload the above files (or a ZIP of the whole repo) and I’ll:\n\n* Produce a per-file summary with exact responsibilities.\n* Provide function-by-function commentary and safe patches for the issues found.\n* Output unified diffs you can apply (and test guidance).\n\n---\n\n# 7) Quick action plan I can do now (choose one)\n\n* I can apply the **CHAT\\_MSG\\_SYSTEM** wrapper + **Reputation matcher** patch and return the patched snippets ready to drop into `initialization.lua` and `core.lua` (I already provided them above).\n* Or I can wait for you to upload the rest of the repo and then produce a full annotated audit and patch diffs.\n\nTell me which you prefer. If you want me to patch files now, say “apply patches” and I’ll produce full replacement files ready to copy/paste.\n"

It’s inspired by Ace3 ergonomics (ease of use, library patterns) and Next/React developer DX (pages, hooks, components, assets). The code is intentionally minimal but real — it gives you:\n\n* A small **WUI core** with `createElement`, vnodes, `useState`, `render` and a simple reconciler.\n* A **Texture Manager** that treats textures as first-class, exposing IDs, caching, and helper getters.\n* A tiny **Router** that supports file-based pages registration and `Link`-style navigation.\n* A couple of convenience **component factories** (`Frame`, `Button`, `Text`, `Image`) that integrate textures.\n* A sample `pages/index.lua` to show usage.\n* A `.toc` to load everything.\n\nThis is enough to start building a Next-like pages system in WoW; from here we can add hooks (`useEffect`), keyed reconciliation, layout primitives (Stacks), themes/skins, atlas handling, build-conversion hooks, ISR-like caching, and dev hot-reload helpers.\n\n**Important:** This runtime assumes you prepare assets in `Interface/AddOns/NextUI/assets/` (native `.tga`/`.blp`) — later we’ll add a build pipeline suggestion to convert PNG/SVG -> BLP/TGA and generate metadata.\n\n---\n\n# Folder & file layout\n\n```\nNextUI/\n  NextUI.toc\n  core/\n    WUICore.lua\n    Textures.lua\n    Router.lua\n    Components.lua\n  pages/\n

Router mounts the page via `WUI.render`, so each page is declarative UI.\n* **Components**: `core/Components.lua` defines reusable UI primitives. Later you’ll provide a package of components (Panel, Modal, Form, Stack, Grid).\n* **Hooks**: `WUI.useState` exists; next we add `useEffect`, `useRef`, and a per-component instance identity model to support multiple component instances.\n* **Textures**: `core/Textures.lua` centralizes asset metadata and application. Next iteration: integrate texture application into the reconciler so `Image`/`Frame._texture` props auto-apply.\n* **Theming & builds**: The build pipeline (outside the game) converts dev-friendly assets to WoW-native files and outputs `Textures.registerAssets({...})` Lua file you can `dofile` at load.\n\n---\n\n# Recommended immediate next steps (I can implement any now)\n\n1. **Integrate textures into reconciler** — add logic in `createFrame` to read `vnode.props._texture` or `props.textures` and call `Textures.applyTexture`. (HIGH priority)\n2. **Make components return proper image/text children** — complete `Image` implementation that creates a FontString or Texture directly.\n3. **Add `useEffect` and per-component instance hook state** — so nested functional components have independent hooks.\n4. **Keyed reconciliation** for lists (so reorder is stable).\n5. **Theme & asset build tooling** — small Node/Python script to convert PNG -> BLP/TGA and produce `assets.lua` with metadata.\n6. **Dev helpers** — a slash command to reload a single page and a “dev mode” that logs diffs.\n\n---\n\n# Build pipeline (outside WoW) — summary plan\n\n* Use a small CLI tool (Node + `sharp` or Python + PIL plus a BLP converter) to:\n\n  * Accept `dev/assets/*` (png, jpg, svg)\n  * Convert to `.tga` or `.blp` (required by WoW)\n  * Output to `Interface/AddOns/NextUI/assets/`\n  * Emit `core/assets.lua` containing `Textures.registerAssets({ ... })` table with width/height/coords\n* This makes asset IDs stable and easy to reference (`\"logo\"`, `\"btn_primary\"`).\n\n---\n\n# Next actionable item — what do you want now?\n\nPick one and I’ll implement it immediately, fully (no omissions):\n\n* A. **Auto-texture integration**: modify the reconciler so `vnode.props._texture` and `props.textures` automatically create and manage textures on frames (with caching + switching states).\n* B. **Per-component hook instances + useEffect**: extend hook system so nested components each have independent hooks and `useEffect` works with cleanup.\n* C. **Build script and generated `assets.lua` example**: produce a small Node script and an example `assets.lua` you can drop into the addon.\n* D. **Full components upgrade**: implement `Image`, `Panel`, `Stack` components and demo pages showing theming.\n\nTell me which one to do first and I’ll deliver the complete, ready-to-drop-in code for that piece.\n"

Here's how to set it up with an OpenRouter API key to route requests to GPT models:\n\n1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure Node.js (v18+) is installed.\n2. **Install Claude Code**: Run `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.\n3. **Install Claude Code Router**: Run `npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router`.\n4. **Get OpenRouter API Key**: Sign up at openrouter.ai, navigate to the API Keys section, create a key, and copy it.\n5. **Configure Router**: Create or edit `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` with:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"Providers\": [\n       {\n         \"name\": \"openrouter\",\n         \"api_base_url\": \"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions\",\n         \"api_key\": \"your-openrouter-api-key\",\n         \"models\": [\"openai/gpt-4\", \"openai/gpt-3.5-turbo\"]\n       }\n     ],\n     \"Router\": {\n       \"default\": \"openrouter,openai/gpt-4\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   Replace `your-openrouter-api-key` with your key.\n6. **Start Router**: Run `ccr` to start Claude Code Router.\n7. **Use Claude Code**: Run `claude` and use as normal; requests route through OpenRouter to GPT models.\n\n**Note**: You need an OpenRouter account, as direct OpenAI GPT API keys aren't supported.

Then, we’ll **organize and explain it professionally** to reflect:\n\n* Real-world **functionality groupings**\n* A logical **developer-first structure**\n* Clean separation of **core, UI, media, and gameplay feature logic**\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Understanding the Scope of the BLU Addon\n\n### 🎮 What is BLU?\n\n**BLU** is a **modular World of Warcraft addon** designed to **enhance game events** like achievements, leveling, quests, and reputations with **custom sound cues and UI overlays**. It is organized as a clean, self-contained addon with no external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Core Design Principles\n\n* **Modular architecture**: Each gameplay mechanic (e.g., achievements, quests) is a separate module.\n* **Central core framework**: Handles event registration, config, and addon lifecycle.\n* **Sound and media driven**: Custom `.ogg` files mapped to game events.\n* **UI abstraction**: Panels and widgets are separated into template-driven interfaces.\n* **Localization support**: Structured to support multiple languages.\n* **Build tooling**: Includes scripts to batch-rename, consolidate, and manage sound files.\n\n---\n\n## 🗂️ Final Structure (Developer-Oriented Breakdown)\n\n```plaintext\nBLU/\n│\n├── 📦 Base Files\n│   ├── BLU.toc              # AddOn entry point (UPPERCASE, required by WoW)\n│   ├── BLU.xml              # Loader XML (UPPERCASE)\n│   ├── README.md            # User-facing doc\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md            # Developer/internal notes\n│   ├── .gitignore, .pkgmeta # Git and CurseForge/Wago configs\n│\n├── 🧠 Core Framework (internal logic & engine)\n│   └── core/\n│       ├── init.lua             # Entry loader\n│       ├── core.lua             # AddOn engine\n│       ├── registry.lua         # Sound event mapping and registry\n│       ├── loader.lua           # Module/component loader\n│       ├── database.lua         # Persistent saved variables\n│       ├── config.lua           # User config defaults\n│       ├── commands.lua         # Slash commands\n│       ├── sharedmedia.lua      # Interface with LibSharedMedia if needed\n│       └── utils.lua            # Utility functions\n│\n├── 🔌 Feature Modules (modular event logic)\n│   └── modules/\n│       ├── Achievement/         # Achievement unlock handler\n│       ├── BattlePet/           # Pet battle event logic\n│       ├── Delve/               # Delve-specific logic (Dragonflight?)\n│       ├── Honor/               # PvP honor tracking\n│       ├── LevelUp/             # Leveling progress alerts\n│       ├── Quest/               # Quest events + custom panel\n│       ├── Renown/              # Renown rank-up support\n│       ├── Reputation/          # Reputation gain/loss handlers\n│       └── TradingPost/         # Trading Post notifications\n│\n├── 🖥️ UI Interface (panels, widgets, tabs)\n│   └── interface/\n│       ├── Design.lua           # Theme and layout settings\n│       ├── Settings.lua         # Settings UI\n│       ├── Tabs.lua             # Navigation tabs\n│       ├── Widgets.lua          # Shared UI widgets\n│       ├── Panels/              # Logical panel UIs\n│       │   ├── About.lua\n│       │   ├── EventSimple.lua\n│       │   ├── General.lua\n│       │   └── Sounds.lua\n│       └── Templates/           # Placeholder for visual templates\n│\n├── 🌍 Localization\n│   └── localization/\n│       └── enUS.lua             # English strings (framework ready for more)\n│\n├── 🎵 Media Assets\n│   └── media/\n│       ├── sounds/              # Cleaned and normalized event sound library\n│       │   ├── *.ogg            # 50+ game-themed alerts\n│       └── Textures/            # UI assets (e.g., play button, preview)\n│\n├── 🔊 Sound Definitions\n│   └── sound/\n│       └── packs/\n│           ├── finalfantasy.lua # Custom sound pack\n│           └── packs.xml        # Master pack loader/index\n│\n├── 🧰 Tooling & Build Scripts\n│   ├── consolidate_sounds.bat   # Merges or removes variants\n│   ├── rename_sounds.ps1        # Normalizes sound filenames\n│   └── .claude/                 # Local dev settings (Claude integration?)\n│       └── settings.local.json\n│\n└── 🧹 Known Cleanup Artifacts (to fix/remove)\n    ├── nul                             # OS bug file (remove manually)\n    └── CUsersJosephGettingsBLUexclude.txt # Broken filename (rename/fix)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Recommended Organization Tips (Already Mostly Implemented)\n\n* ✅ **One folder = one responsibility**: Already done with `/core`, `/modules`, `/interface`, `/media`, etc.\n* ✅ **No mixed case filenames**: Except `.toc` and `.xml` (by Blizzard design)\n* ✅ **All modules fully self-contained** (no cross-import chaos)\n* ✅ **Future-proof**: `libs/` is ready, `Templates/` is staged for expansion\n* ⛔️ **Pending**: Remove `nul` and broken Windows file paths\n* ⚠️ **Optional**: Split `media/sounds` into subfolders (e.g. `media/sounds/levelup/`, `media/sounds/pvp/`) if it grows again\n\n---\n\n## ✅ BLU Addon is Now:\n\n* **Modular**: Easily test and disable components\n* **Media-rich**: Immediate game feedback through custom sounds\n* **Clean**: Fast iteration, no tech debt\n* **Dev-ready**: Auto-sync to WoW for local testing\n\n---\n\nWould you like:\n\n* A `release.md` for tagging this cleanup release?\n* An automatic TOC `.pkgmeta` generator for CurseForge?\n* An `init.lua` summary flowchart showing how everything initializes?\n\nLet me know what you want to document or automate next.\n"
